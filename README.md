# **NIST CSF \- DDoS Incident Response**

## **Project Introduction**

This project details the analysis of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack experienced by a multimedia company, using the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** as a guiding structure. As a cybersecurity analyst, I've outlined a comprehensive plan to improve network security, covering the five core functions of the NIST CSF: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. This demonstrates a proactive approach to cybersecurity risk management and incident preparedness.

## **Methodology and Analysis**

The project is based on a scenario where a multimedia company's internal network was compromised for two hours due to an ICMP flood DDoS attack via an unconfigured firewall. My approach involved applying each core function of the NIST CSF to dissect the incident and formulate strategies for future security enhancement.

My methodology involved:

1. **Incident Summary:** Providing a concise overview of the DDoS attack, its cause, impact, and initial resolution.  
2. **Identify:** Pinpointing the specific type of attack and the systems affected.  
3. **Protect:** Assessing current security gaps and proposing immediate action plans to safeguard organizational assets.  
4. **Detect:** Devising methods to continuously monitor network traffic and detect similar incidents efficiently in the future.  
5. **Respond:** Developing a structured plan for containing, neutralizing, and analyzing future security incidents.  
6. **Recover:** Outlining steps for restoring affected systems and data to normal operations post-incident.

## **NIST CSF Incident Report & Plan**

A detailed incident report and strategic plan, structured around the NIST CSF, is provided in the NIST\_CSF\_Incident\_Report.md file within this repository.

## **Key Learnings**

This activity reinforced the importance of:

* **Understanding DDoS Attacks:** Recognizing the characteristics and impact of ICMP flood attacks.  
* **Applying the NIST CSF:** Utilizing a structured framework for comprehensive cybersecurity risk management.  
* **Proactive Security:** Shifting from reactive incident response to proactive measures across all phases of the security lifecycle.  
* **Layered Security:** Implementing multiple security controls (firewall rules, IDS/IPS, monitoring) for defense-in-depth.  
* **Incident Response Planning:** Developing clear procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.
